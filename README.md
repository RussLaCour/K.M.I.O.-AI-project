# K.M.I.O.-AI-project

KMIO is a space shoot-em-up created by Russell LaCour and Kenny Jeannite. The game was created in python using PyGame.
You are a new recruit for the Kuiper Militarized Intergalatic Operations (or K.M.I.O.); a new branch of the military 
created to patrol and secure the Kuiper belt, after the discovery of intergalatic travel. The controls are simple. 
You move the player around with the arrow keys and shoot using the spacebar.

This game is currently being remade using the Unity Engine.
